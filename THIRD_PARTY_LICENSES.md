### Gradient-Editor by Sebastian Lague

The custom gradient editor in this project was inspired by the Gradient-Editor project
by Sebastian Lague (https://github.com/SebLague/Gradient-Editor).

The Gradient-Editor repository does not include an explicit license file.
However, it is referenced from Sebastian Lague's Solar-System project which is MIT licensed,
and the concepts used here (sorted color stops with linear interpolation) are standard
computer graphics techniques. Our implementation is an original Rust/FLTK port.
